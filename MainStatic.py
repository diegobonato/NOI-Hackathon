"""

Main function that performs the following tasks:
- Detects if a car is arriving
- Detects if the car is electric or not
- Detects if a person is getting out of the car
- Profiles the person
- Detects if the person is happy or not
- Starts the charging phase
- Mines the video to get as much data as possible
- Sends the data to the API

Output:
{'age': 34, 'gender': 'Man', 'ethnicity': 'white', 'emotion': 'neutral', 'time_stamp': '2023-11-11 05:27:17'}
